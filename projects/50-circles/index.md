## Fifty Ways to Draw a Circle

Earlier this year I was looking around for project ideas that could use
multiple different parts of my mind. I've been working on a generative art
project for a while now, and it's at a point of some stuckness -- I can think
of a few directions I could take it in, but they're all pretty big projects
of their own and they might not show results for a while. So I was excited
when I happened across this blog post titled [Seventy-Five Ways to Draw a
Circle](https://sighack.com/post/seventy-five-ways-to-draw-a-circle).

The goal of the exercise is to come up with several different ways of drawing
a circle, or more to the point, a circle-like image.  I'm using the same
constraints described in that post:

> First, I decided to forego the use of color as I wanted to focus on
> variety in forms instead. I also find that using color variations to get
> out of a rut makes me feel like I'm cheating.
>
> Second, every version should be implemented as an independent, re-usable
> function conforming to the following declaration:
>
> ```
>   void circle(float x, float y, float r) {
>     /* Draw a circle with center at (x, y) and radius r */
>   }
> ```
>
> This way, I can easily reuse them later for other works.
>
> As the third and final constraint, each version had to have some
> generative/procedural component to it. That is, each time the function is
> called, a new variant should be generated.

I stopped reading that post after getting as far as that description,
because I wanted to avoid anchoring myself on any of the specific ideas
there.  But the exercise seemed like just the thing for me.  It forced me
to keep going back to the well of ideas even after I felt convinced that
the well must have run dry, and I kept proving myself wrong.  Once I'd done
the hard work of generating the idea, I got to practice using my aesthetic
sense to tell me when it felt done, and I knew I could rely on my
programming and math skills to turn the idea into an image.  Each
individual circle could be pretty quick, so I got to see incremental
progress all the time.  And I could decide to stop whenever I wanted; for
me, fifty circles seemed like a good number.

So, without further ado, here are the results.  There's one image for each
style of circle, showing four examples of that style.  Clicking on any
image will give an enlarged version with more detail.  All of the source
code is available on [Github](https://github.com/blakej11/50-circles).
