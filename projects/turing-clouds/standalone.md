## Turing clouds - running a dedicated installation

The [software package](https://github.com/blakej11/zounds) I've written to
generate Turing clouds is designed to run just fine on a modern laptop
(which a [Cray supercomputer from a few decades
ago](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cray-2) would look at in envy!).  But
that doesn't provide a great way for multiple users to interact with it,
and it assumes a certain amount of knowledge of how the program works
(especially for the key commands). For the first public demonstration of
the program in August 2019, I built a custom rig which was optimized for
portability but still powerful enough to create a great experience. It
included:

- Computer: [2018 Mac Mini, basic
  configuration](https://amazon.com/dp/B07K2M9FLB)
- GPU: [Sonnet eGFX Breakaway Puck,
  Radeon RX 570](https://amazon.com/dp/B07SKC8HT7)
- Projector: [BenQ HT2050A](https://amazon.com/dp/B077TG22H3)
- Camera: [Logitech C615 webcam](https://amazon.com/dp/B004YW7WCY)
- Mouse: [Ipevo IW2 wireless whiteboard
  system](https://amazon.com/dp/B01MZXDGZ2)
- Keyboard: [Macally USB numeric keypad](https://amazon.com/dp/B079HF1HLM)
- [celexon projector case, large](https://amazon.com/dp/B015OF9222)

The biggest change in experience comes from the Ipevo wireless whiteboard
system.  It has a wireless pen along with a dedicated camera to track the
pen. Once it is configured, you can basically wave the pen around at the
projected image, and the image responds in a way that feels slightly
magical.  But in order to make that work, you also need a projector and a
GPU that is powerful enough to render fluidly at the projector's
resolution.  I also used this as an opportunity to make a simpler keyboard
interface - I put sticky labels onto the keys of a standalone numeric
keypad, and added a dedicated set of key bindings for use with that keypad.
