## Turing clouds - running a dedicated installation

The [software package](https://github.com/blakej11/zounds) I've written to
generate Turing clouds is designed to run just fine on a modern laptop
(which a [Cray supercomputer from a few decades
ago](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cray-2) would look at in envy!).  But
that doesn't provide a great way for multiple users to interact with it,
and it assumes a certain amount of knowledge of how the program works
(especially for the key commands). For the first public demonstration of
the program in August 2019, I built a custom rig which was optimized for
portability but still powerful enough to create a great experience. It
included:

- Computer: [2018 Mac Mini, basic
  configuration](https://amazon.com/dp/B07K2M9FLB)
- GPU: [Sonnet eGFX Breakaway Puck,
  Radeon RX 570](https://amazon.com/dp/B07SKC8HT7)
- Projector: [BenQ HT2050A](https://amazon.com/dp/B077TG22H3)
- Camera: [Logitech C615 webcam](https://amazon.com/dp/B004YW7WCY)
- Mouse: [Ipevo IW2 wireless whiteboard
  system](https://amazon.com/dp/B01MZXDGZ2)
- Keyboard: [Macally USB numeric keypad](https://amazon.com/dp/B079HF1HLM)
- [celexon projector case, large](https://amazon.com/dp/B015OF9222)

The biggest change in experience comes from the [Ipevo wireless whiteboard
system](https://www.ipevo.com/prods/IW2_Wireless_Interactive_Whiteboard_System).
It has a wireless pen along with a dedicated camera to track the pen. Once
it's configured, you can basically wave the pen around at the projected
image, and the image responds in a way that feels slightly magical.  But in
order to make that work, you also need a projector and a GPU that is
powerful enough to render fluidly at the projector's resolution.

When I put that hardware setup together, I used it as an opportunity to
make a simpler keyboard interface as well - I put sticky labels onto the
keys of a standalone numeric keypad, and added a dedicated set of key
bindings for use with that keypad.

Although the software works on Linux, the Ipevo IW2 only supports Windows
and MacOS.  So, for right now, running this kind of setup does require a
Mac.  If you want to try playing with this setup without shelling out for
all that hardware, and you're in the Bay Area, contact me about exhibiting
it.
